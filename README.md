# Advent of Code

<sup>My feeble attempts at looking smart</sup>

## Running

To run against input execute following command:

```sh
npm run execute YYYY/DD
```

where YYYY - year of the event and DD is day of the event (with 0 prepended in case of singular digits)

## Testing

To run tests with sample input:

```
npm test YYYY/DD
```

To start tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch YYYY/DD
```
